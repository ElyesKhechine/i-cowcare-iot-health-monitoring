# I-Cow-Care: IoT System for AI-Based Cow Health Monitoring

### INSAT IIA4

**Technologies:** Embedded C, ESP32, UART, I2C, MQTT, Mosquitto, CSV, JSON, Node-RED, Firebase, Edge Impulse, DNN

## Introduction

This project presents an IoT solution for cow health monitoring. The IoT device (Wearable Collar for cows) will help cow breeders detect cow health problems, and cow reproduction cycle in order to increase milk productivity and help prevent sickness and diseases among cows. This also gives the user easy access to the cow's vital indicators and helps predict its needs.

We used an ESP32, MLX90614 temperature sensor, LIS2DH accelerometer, and Lithium Polymer battery for power.

The steps below presenting the work done to establish the IoT network and prepare the hardware and software environment are going to be tackled with more details later.

1/ Install MQTT: MQTT will be our data transfer protocol using Wifi. We can use local or online MQTT servers. In our case we use Mosquitto MQTT locally and HiveMQTT as an online server.

2/ Prepare the script to connect to Wifi and MQTT, read data from sensors, and send data to the database/dashboard using MQTT protocol...(includes testing sensors, importing libraries, timestamp, etc.)

3/ Prepare the database for data storage and management using Firebase.

4/ Prepare a dashboard for data visualization and analysis using Node-RED.

5/ Hardware design: 3D mechanical and electronic design.

6/ Train machine learning models using Edge Impulse Platform for Embedded ML.


## Project Scope

Commencing from March 23, 2023, to June 1, 2023, the project undertook comprehensive research and development phases to design and implement an intelligent system for continuous cow health monitoring.

## Getting Started

# 1/ Installation and environment preparation

### Install Mosquitto MQTT 

in our case, the implementation was on Windows 10, and the procedure is similar for Linux, and MacOS

1/ Download link: https://mosquitto.org/download/
2/ Modify the configuration file:
To ensure the proper functioning of the Mosquitto broker, you need to manually modify the listener configuration for port 1883 in the configuration file in Mosquitto root folder.
3/ Start the MQTT server by running this command in the mosquitto root folder :
  
```bash
mosquitto -c mosquitto. conf -v
```
4/ To get the IP address, run this command (IPV4 in our case) :
```bash
ip config
```
5/ Configure the ESP32 code to connect to the MQTT server.

### Install Node-RED

1/ Download link: https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/. You need to install node.js.

2/ Run Node-RED using this command :
  
```bash
node-red
```
3/ A local webpage will open in your browser to create, modify and connect your devices and different functions. You can connect to the database / MQTT server...

### Write script for ESP32 :

1/ We used Arduino IDE to program the ESP32  You'll find the whole script and library in the repository.

### Deep Learning :

1/ Data Preprocessing:  We engaged in data preprocessing, a step that involved tasks such as data cleansing, noise reduction, and handling missing values within the CSV dataset.

2/ Feature Extraction: We extracted spectral and temporal features from the preprocessed data.

3/ Neural Network Construction and Training: We designed and trained a neural network tailored to our dataset using the Edge Impulse platform. We then exported the TfLite model.

### 3D Design :
We used SolidWorks to design different parts of the device.

## Next Steps :
The project is far from being perfect or completed. The following steps may include enlarging and building a bigger database to ensure our sufficiency of data for model training. It may also include building a mobile application to facilitate access to data and different stats for different categories of users.
